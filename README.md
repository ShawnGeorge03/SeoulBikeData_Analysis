# Predictive Model for Bike Usage in City of Seoul

This report looks into the Seoul Public Bike (Ttareungyi) initiative in South Korea to use this data to understand how weather affects bike usage and develop a model to predict future rentals. The report looks into the following:

- Hourly bike rentals: Track ridership patterns and understand usage trends.
- Weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.): Analyze how weather conditions impact bike usage.
- Timeframe: December 1st, 2017 to December 1st, 2018: One year of data for comprehensive analysis.

## Why Public Bike Rentals?

Public bike rentals are a growing transportation option in cities worldwide. They offer several benefits:

- **Reduced Traffic Congestion, Noise, and Air Pollution**: By encouraging cycling as an alternative to private vehicles, bike rentals contribute to a more breathable and efficient urban environment.
- **Affordable Transportation**: Bike rentals provide a cost-effective way to navigate short distances within a city, particularly beneficial for residents who may not have access to personal vehicles.
- **Improved Public Health**: Cycling offers a healthy mode of transportation, promoting physical activity and potentially reducing reliance on cars.
