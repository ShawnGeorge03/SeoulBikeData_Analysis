## Introduction

In the past decade, the usage of public rental bikes has increased in various 
urban cities. In cities, rental bikes have become a crucial part of transportation
because of many reasons. They provide free or affordable access to transportation
for short-distance trips instead of requiring a private vehicle and help reduce 
congestion, noise and air pollution in a city (Winters, 2020). Bike Sharing systems
are now rapidly growing across the world at nearly 2000 various operating programs
in total as of May 2021 (Yu et al., 2021). The demand for these systems is growing
at 14.3% compounded annually from 2017 to 2025 (Cooper, 2019). 
 
There are various public bike rental systems across the world, like in the city 
of Toronto where they have approximately 6,850 bikes and its users have completed
2.9 million trips as of 2020 (Bike Share Toronto, 2021). In New York City there 
are "... nearly eight hundred thousand (773,000) ride a bicycle regularly" and 
have completed over 7 million rides as of September 2021 with a 26% growth in 
daily cycling between 2014 to 2019 (New York City DOT, 2021). One of the biggest
bike-sharing systems is found in China at Hangzhou and Wuhan where their residents
have access to 90,000 and 70,000 bicycles respectively 
(Borowska-Stefa≈Ñska et al., 2021). 
 
Like many other cities within the world, the city of Seoul in South Korea has 
also founded a bike-sharing system called _Ttareungyi_ or Seoul Public Bike 
started in 2015. It was started to " resolve issues of traffic congestion, air 
pollution, and high oil prices in Seoul, and to build a healthier society while 
enhancing the quality of life for Seoul citizens" (Seoul Metropolitan Government,
2015). As of March 20, 2018, it has exceeded 620,000 memberships with 38% of the 
users using the bikes during rush hour (Seoul Metropolitan Government, 2018). Due
to the high usage of bikes in cities, effective management of bike-sharing systems 
must be developed to ensure the general public can access the service when required.
 
The following data set from the Seoul Public Bike initiative provides various 
information like the number of bikes rented, temperature, humidity, wind speed, 
visibility, solar radiation, snowfall and more. This can be used to see how 
weather affects the number of bikes rented per hour and makes a predictive model
for future uses from the given data from December 1st, 2017 to December 1st, 2018. 
This is a very important question to consider since an online survey conducted 
within the geographical region of Asia in 2016 identified,  climate as an "... 
important physical barrier with 25% of respondents strongly agreeing that it 
constrains them physically, particularly warm or warmth and high precipitation 
levels."(Mateo-Babiano et al., 2017) among other reasons like infrastructure 
issues and others.

We will do this by first cleaning the data, making visualizations to see trends 
between variables and then generating and inspecting the model and summary statistics
and using diagnostics to improve the model and deal with outliers and such. Some 
variables will be left out due to high multicollinearity issues or not contributing
much to the model which was found using leaps and AIC criterion.

We start first with analyzing the data to verify that there are no missing values
in any of the columns, change the format of certain variables to make it easier 
to make visualization from the data. After taking a look at the column names of 
the data set we decide to change the names to be it easier to use. Then we ran a
check on each column of the data set to look for missing values and found none.
We also decided to drop the variable _FunctioningDay_ which is there to
indicate if the bike-sharing system is available or not and if we observe 
the number of rented bikes we see that it is 0 for 
`r dim.data.frame(myData[myData$FunctioningDay=="No",])[1]` observations where 
_FunctioningDay_ is "No". Since here we are trying to predict how many bikes will
be rented when the system is open. For this reason, we can remove these observations.
We also formatted the _Date_ column to by using a built-in date function to help
when we need to make graphs and such.

```{r Cleaning Data, echo=FALSE}
colnames(myData) = c("Date", "RentedBikeCount", "Hour", "Temperature", "Humidity",
                     "Windspeed", "Visibility", "DewPointTemp", "SolarRadiation",
                     "Rainfall", "Snowfall", "Seasons", "Holiday", "FunctioningDay")
checkNullValues = sapply(colnames(myData), FUN = function(col.name) 
                                                  any(is.na(myData[,col.name])))
knitr::kable(checkNullValues, format="simple", col.names = "Is Null")
rm(checkNullValues)
myData = myData[myData$FunctioningDay=="Yes",]
myData = within.data.frame(myData, rm(FunctioningDay))
myData$Date = as.Date(myData$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
```

\newpage

## Exploratory Data Analysis

After cleaning the data set we have `r dim.data.frame(myData)[1]` observations.
In this section, we will be taking a look at some of the 
`r dim.data.frame(myData)[2]` variables and consider their effect on our
response variable _RentedBikeCount_ and the relationship between explanatory 
variables themselves. We will also make a decision with regard to which variables
to keep for the model building.

### Correlation Heat Map

```{r Correlation Map, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 3}
library(reshape2)

cor_dat = subset(myData, select=c("RentedBikeCount", "Temperature", "Humidity", "Windspeed", "Visibility", "DewPointTemp", "SolarRadiation", "Rainfall", "Snowfall"))
cor_mat = round(cor(cor_dat),2)
ggplot(melt(cor_mat), aes(Var2, Var1, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "red", mid = "white", 
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1,1), space = "Lab",
                       name="Pearson\nCorrelation") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, size = 10, hjust = 1),) +
  geom_text(aes(Var2, Var1, label = value), color = "black", size = 4) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank())
rm(cor_dat, cor_mat)
detach("package:reshape2", unload=TRUE)
```
From Figure 1 which is the Correlation Heat Map we can observe that the 
correlation between the explanatory variables DewPointTemp and Temperature is 
0.91 which is quite high and so one of them will be dropped to reduce 
multicollinearity. We decided to drop DewPointTemp and kept Temperature as a
possible variable to be used since it correlated much strongly to 
RentedBikeCount. We can also notice that Visibility, SolarRadiation and Snowfall 
correlate well with RentedBikeCount.

### RentedBikeCount 

The _RentedBikeCount_ is the response variable that we are trying to predict from 
our model. This variable will be represented as the variable _Y_. From the summary
of the variable, we see that at minimum there are 2 bikes rented with a maximum of 3556
bikes rented at once and on average 729 bikes. From the histogram, we see that many
of the observations are less than the average number of bikes represented by the blue 
line rented and from the boxplot we see that number of bikes rent is pretty similar
between each observation for the most part with some observations as outliers.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=1.5}
hp = ggplot(myData, aes(x=RentedBikeCount)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white", bins=50) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(RentedBikeCount)),
            color="red", linetype="solid", size=1) + 
  labs(x = "# Rented Bikes")

bxp = ggplot(myData ,mapping = aes(y = RentedBikeCount, group=1)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + labs(y = "# Rented Bikes")

ggarrange(hp, bxp, ncol=2, nrow=1)

rm(hp, bxp)
```

### Date 

The _Date_ column of the data set stores the date during which this observation was 
taken and is in the format of (year-month-day). This in its self will not be 
providing much information but breaking the date into specific days of the week can help
to see the general trend of usage throughout a week and specifically the demand
weekdays and weekends. So after making a graph that plots the average number of 
bikes used per hour for each day of the week we can see that the demand change 
significantly based on if it is a weekday or weekend. The two peaks in the weekday 
can be explained by the start of workday and school which is approximately 8 AM
and the end of the workday and school which is approximately 5 PM on average.
Since there is a significant change in demand based on if it is a weekend or 
not we will make a categorical variable where 1 represents weekend and 0 
represents not weekend with a base category that will be set to not weekend.

```{r Day of Week Demand, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 2.5}
myData$WeekDay = format(myData$Date, "%a")
matrixOfMeanHrs = matrix(data=NA, nrow=24, ncol=7, dimnames=(list(c(1:24),unique(myData$WeekDay))))
for (weekday in colnames(matrixOfMeanHrs)){
  weekdayData = subset(myData[myData$WeekDay == weekday, ], select=c("Hour", "RentedBikeCount"))
  for (hour in unique(myData[,"Hour"])){
    matrixOfMeanHrs[hour + 1, weekday] = mean(weekdayData[weekdayData["Hour"] == hour, "RentedBikeCount"])
  }
}
MeanHrs = data.frame(c(1:24), matrixOfMeanHrs[, "Mon"], 
                              matrixOfMeanHrs[, "Tue"],
                              matrixOfMeanHrs[, "Wed"],
                              matrixOfMeanHrs[, "Thu"],
                              matrixOfMeanHrs[, "Fri"],
                              matrixOfMeanHrs[, "Sat"],
                              matrixOfMeanHrs[, "Sun"])
colnames(MeanHrs) = c("Hours", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
                      "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
ggplot(MeanHrs, aes(x=Hours - 1)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=Monday, color="Monday")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=Tuesday, color="Tuesday")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=Wednesday, color="Wenesday")) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Thursday, color="Thursday")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=Friday, color="Friday")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=Saturday, color="Saturday")) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Sunday, color="Sunday")) + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#003f5c", "#374c80", "#7a5195", "#bc5090", 
                              "#ef5675", "#ff764a", "#ffa600")) +
  labs(x = "Hours", y = "Mean Rented Bikes Count", color='Day of Week')

#Create Weekend Indicator
myData$Weekend = 0
for(i in seq(1:length(myData$Weekend))){
  if(myData[i,"WeekDay"] %in% c("Sun","Sat")){
    myData[i,"Weekend"] = 1
  }
}

rm(matrixOfMeanHrs, weekday, weekdayData, hour, MeanHrs, i)
```


### Hours

The _Hour_ column of the data set records the hour of the day this observation was 
taken and is in the format of 24 hrs ranging from 0 to 23. As mentioned when we discussed
the _Date_ column, we saw that the hour played a huge role in the demand
for bikes throughout the day. From the graphs below we also see that
combining the _Weekend_ and _Hour_ variables shows more information about the fluctuating
demaand of bike usage. So, we make Hour into a categorical variable corresponding
to a specific hour of the day with the base category being Hour 23.
```{r Hours vs. Mean Rented Bikes Count, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3.5}
Hours = unique(myData$Hour)

meanBikeRentalPerHourOnWeekend = rep(0, length(Hours))
for (idx in seq(length(Hours))){
  myDataWeekday = myData[myData$Weekend == 1,]
  meanBikeRentalPerHourOnWeekend[idx] = mean(myDataWeekday[myDataWeekday$Hour == Hours[idx], "RentedBikeCount"])
}
hour_weekend = ggplot(mapping = aes(y=meanBikeRentalPerHourOnWeekend,x=Hours, fill=Hours)) +
  geom_col() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low="grey",high="black") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Hours", y = "Mean Rented Bikes Count on Weekend")

meanBikeRentalPerHourOnWeekday = rep(0, length(Hours))
for (idx in seq(length(Hours))){
  myDataWeekend = myData[myData$Weekend == 0,]
  meanBikeRentalPerHourOnWeekday[idx] = mean(myDataWeekend[myDataWeekend$Hour == Hours[idx], "RentedBikeCount"])
}
hour_weekday = ggplot(mapping = aes(y=meanBikeRentalPerHourOnWeekday,x=Hours, fill=Hours)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low="grey",high="black") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Hours", y = "Mean Rented Bikes Count on Weekday")

ggarrange(hour_weekend, hour_weekday, ncol=2, nrow=1)
rm(Hours, meanBikeRentalPerHourOnWeekend, myDataWeekday, hour_weekend, meanBikeRentalPerHourOnWeekday, myDataWeekend, idx, hour_weekday)
```

### Temperature

Temperature was measured in degree Celsius (‚ÑÉ) at the hour of observation. The  lowest 
temperature reached was -17.80 ‚ÑÉ and the highest it went was 39.40 ‚ÑÉ  and on
average the temperature was at 12.77 ‚ÑÉ. From the graph on the left, we can see 
the temperature has a daily trend and with the graph on the right we can see
that there is an association between Temperature and RentedBikeCount whereas generally an increase in 
Temperature increases the number of bikes rented.

```{r AverageDaily Temp & Temp vs. RentedBikeCount, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3}
DailyMeanTemperature = aggregate(Temperature ~ Date, myData, mean)
AverageTemp_Date = ggplot(DailyMeanTemperature ,mapping = aes(y=Temperature,x=Date)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0), color="black", linetype="solid", size=1) 
RentedBikeCount_Temp = ggplot(myData,mapping = aes(y=RentedBikeCount,x=Temperature)) + geom_point()
ggarrange(AverageTemp_Date, RentedBikeCount_Temp, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
rm(DailyMeanTemperature, AverageTemp_Date, RentedBikeCount_Temp)
```

### Humidity

Humidity was measured in % at the hour of observation. In regards to the values, we have 0% as the lowest and 98% as the highest
for Humidity with an average of 57 %. From the graph on the
left, we can see that Humidity has an hourly trend and there was no noticeable Daily
and Monthly Humidity Trend. In the graph on the right, we can see that the number of 
bikes rented varies slightly based on the graph.
```{r AverageHourly Humid & Humid vs. RentedBikeCount, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3}
HourlyMeanHumidity = aggregate(Humidity ~ Hour, myData, mean)

AverageHumid_Hour = ggplot(HourlyMeanHumidity ,mapping = aes(y=Humidity,x=Hour)) + geom_point()
RentedBikeCount_Humid = ggplot(myData,mapping = aes(y=RentedBikeCount,x=Humidity)) + geom_point()
ggarrange(AverageHumid_Hour, RentedBikeCount_Humid, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)

rm(HourlyMeanHumidity, AverageHumid_Hour, RentedBikeCount_Humid)
```

### Visibility

The distance till which an object or light can be clearly seen is measured in 
meters (m) at the hour of observation. The average distance visible for a biker is 1690 m
and it can go down as low as 27 m and as high as 2000 m. From the graph on the
left, we can see that Visibility has an hourly trend and that there was no noticeable Daily
and/or Monthly Visibility Trend. In the graph on the right, we can see that the number of 
bikes rented varies based on the Visibility variable and if we go left to right
the number of bikes rented increases as Visibility increases.
```{r AverageHourly Visi & Visi vs. RentedBikeCount, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3}
HourlyMeanVisibility = aggregate(Visibility ~ Hour, myData, mean)

AverageVisi_Hour = ggplot(HourlyMeanVisibility ,mapping = aes(y=Visibility,x=Hour)) + geom_point()
RentedBikeCount_Visi = ggplot(myData,mapping = aes(y=RentedBikeCount,x=Visibility)) + geom_point()
ggarrange(AverageVisi_Hour, RentedBikeCount_Visi, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)

rm(HourlyMeanVisibility,AverageVisi_Hour,RentedBikeCount_Visi)
```

### Solar Radiation

The _SolarRadiation_ column in the data set is the solar radiation experienced, 
measured in $\frac{Mj}{m^2}$, at the hour of observation. On average according to 
this data set Seoul gets 0.5679 $\frac{Mj}{m^2}$ with a maximum of 3.52 
$\frac{Mj}{m^2}$ of solar radiation for one observation. 
From the graph on the left, we can see that solar radiation throughout the 
year and is quite consistent. Looking at its relationship with 
RentedBikeCount we see that 
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3.5, out.height="20%"}
myData$Month = format(myData$Date, "%b")
MonthlyMeanSolarRadiation = aggregate(SolarRadiation ~ Month, myData, mean)

MonthlyMean_SolarRadiation = ggplot(MonthlyMeanSolarRadiation, aes(x=factor(Month, levels = month.abb), y=SolarRadiation, fill=factor(Month, levels = month.abb))) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x="Month", y="Monthly Solar Radiation") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Months"))
RentedBikeCount_SR = ggplot(myData,mapping = aes(y=RentedBikeCount,x=SolarRadiation)) + geom_point()
ggarrange(MonthlyMean_SolarRadiation, RentedBikeCount_SR, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)

rm(MonthlyMeanSolarRadiation, MonthlyMean_SolarRadiation, RentedBikeCount_SR)
```

### Rainfall

The _Rainfall_ column in the data set is the rainfall experienced, measured in 
millimetres (mm), at the hour of observation. On average according to this data set
Seoul gets 0.15 mm with a maximum of 35 mm of rainfall for one observation. 
From the graph on the left, we can see that rainfall throughout the year with the
most amount falling in the month of May. Looking at its relationship with 
RentedBikeCount we see that it has quite the effect by decreasing the number of 
bikes rented on those days.
```{r Monthly Max Rainfall, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3.5, out.height="20%"}
MonthlyMaxRF = aggregate(Rainfall ~ Month, myData, max)

MaxRF_Month = ggplot(MonthlyMaxRF, aes(x=factor(Month, levels = month.abb), y=Rainfall, fill=factor(Month, levels = month.abb))) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x="Month", y="Monthly Rainfall") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Months"))
RentedBikeCount_RF = ggplot(myData,mapping = aes(y=RentedBikeCount,x=Rainfall)) + geom_point()
ggarrange(MaxRF_Month, RentedBikeCount_RF, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)

rm(MonthlyMaxRF, MaxRF_Month, RentedBikeCount_RF)
```

### Snowfall

The _Snowfall_ column in the data set is the snowfall experienced, measured in 
centimetres (cm), at the hour of observation. On average according to this data set
Seoul gets 0.08 cm or 0.8 mm with a maximum of 8.8 cm of snowfall for one 
observation. From the graph on the left, we can see that Snowfall only falls in 
the first 2 and last 2 months of the year and mostly comes down during November. 
Looking at its relationship with RentedBikeCount we see that it has quite the 
effect of decreasing the number of bikes rented on those days.
```{r Monthly Max Snowfall, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3.5, out.height="20%"}
MonthlyMaxSF = aggregate(Snowfall ~ Month, myData, max)

MaxSnowfall_Month = ggplot(MonthlyMaxSF, aes(x=factor(Month, levels = month.abb), y=Snowfall, fill=factor(Month, levels = month.abb))) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x="Month", y="Monthly Snowfall") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Months"))
RentedBikeCount_Snowfall = ggplot(myData,mapping = aes(y=RentedBikeCount,x=Snowfall)) + geom_point()
ggarrange(MaxSnowfall_Month, RentedBikeCount_Snowfall, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)

rm(MonthlyMaxSF, MaxSnowfall_Month, RentedBikeCount_Snowfall)
```

### Seasons

_Season_ is a column in the data set that states what Season was this observation
taken in. From the graph below we can see that the Season most definitely affects the number of bikes rented on average. In the Winter season, you see
the lowest number of bikes rented and in the Summer season, you see the highest
number of bikes rented. Autumn and Spring seasons on the other hand are relatively close to each
other. Adding the _Seasons_ to the model as a categorical variable for the current
season in Seoul (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) with the base category being set 
to Autumn will make an effect on the model.
```{r Mean Bike Count Vs. Seasons, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 5, fig.height = 2.5 ,out.height="20%"}
Seasons = unique(myData$Seasons)
meanBikeRentalPerSeason = rep(0, length(Seasons))
for (idx in seq(length(Seasons))){
  meanBikeRentalPerSeason[idx] = mean(myData[myData$Seasons == Seasons[idx], "RentedBikeCount"])
}
ggplot(data=as.data.frame(meanBikeRentalPerSeason)) +
  geom_col(aes(x=Seasons, y=meanBikeRentalPerSeason, fill=Seasons)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#003f5c", "#7a5195", "#ef5675", "#ffa600")) +
  labs(x = "Seasons", y = "Mean Rented Bikes Count")
rm(Seasons, meanBikeRentalPerSeason, idx)
```

### Holiday

_Holiday_ is a column in the data set that states if that _Date_ is a "Holiday" 
or "No Holiday". Looking at the graph below we see that is quite similar to the
day of the week above in the _Date_ section. Therefore, adding the _Holiday_
variable to the model will most likely add no extra information and so it will 
be excludedhe model will most likely add no extra information and so it will 
be excluded
```{r Mean Bike Count Vs. Holiday Status, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2.5,}
matrixOfMeanHrs = matrix(data=NA, nrow=24, ncol=2, dimnames=(list(c(1:24), unique(myData$Holiday))))
for (holidayStatus in colnames(matrixOfMeanHrs)){
  HolidayData = subset(myData[myData$Holiday == holidayStatus, ], select=c("Hour", "RentedBikeCount"))
  for (hour in unique(myData[,"Hour"])){
    matrixOfMeanHrs[hour + 1, holidayStatus] = mean(HolidayData[HolidayData["Hour"] == hour, "RentedBikeCount"])
  }
}
MeanHrs = data.frame(c(1:24), matrixOfMeanHrs[, "Holiday"], matrixOfMeanHrs[, "No Holiday"])
colnames(MeanHrs) = c("Hours", "Holiday", "NoHoliday")
ggplot(MeanHrs, aes(x=Hours - 1)) + 
  labs(x = "Hours", y = "Mean Rented Bikes Count", color="") +
  geom_line(aes(y=Holiday, color="Holiday")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=NoHoliday, color="No Holiday"))
rm(matrixOfMeanHrs, holidayStatus, HolidayData, hour, MeanHrs)
```

## Model Building & Validation

```{r Gather Continuous Variables, include=FALSE}
Y = myData$RentedBikeCount
X1 = myData$Hour
X2 = myData$Temperature
X3 = myData$Humidity
X4 = myData$Windspeed
X5 = myData$Visibility
X7 = myData$SolarRadiation
X8 = myData$Rainfall
X9 = myData$Snowfall

weekends = myData$Weekend
```

We start with building the model with all the given variables: X0 (Date), X1(Hour),
X2(Temperature), X3(Humidity), X4(Windspeed), X5(Visibility), X7(Solar Radiation),
X8(Rainfall), X9(Snowfall), X10(Seasons), X11(Holiday), and the weekend variable.

After inspecting the cleaned data, our initial assumption was to classify 
X10 (Seasons), and the weekend variable as categorical(binary) variables, 
while the rest should be classified as continuous variables. 

Then, by using the package leaps() we find the best subset of continuous variables.

```{r Finding best subset of Continuous Variables, include=FALSE}
library(leaps)
regsubset = regsubsets(Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 + X7 + X8 + X9, nbest=4, data = myData)
aprout = summary(regsubset)
n = length(Y)
p = apply(aprout$which, 1, sum)
aprout$aic = aprout$bic - log(n) * p + 2 * p
with(aprout, round(cbind(which, rsq, adjr2, cp, bic, aic), 3))
rm(regsubset, aprout, n, p)
```

After running it we found that the best subset of continuous variables is all of
them except X4 which is windspeed since it had the lowest AIC of -6061.978.

We now decide to include the categorical variables with the model, which are 
and Weekends. Then, based on several iterations of the ANOVA Table 
outputs, we tried to fit a model that gave us a considerably good Adjusted 
R-squared value as well as a good VIF value, among other considerations for 
fitting the best model. 

After several iterations and inspections, we came up with the following assumptions:

  1. The Seasons and Weekend variables should be included in the model.
  2. Convert the Hour variable into a categorical variable and use it with 
  the Seasons categorical variable.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(MASS)

D1 = as.numeric(myData$Seasons == "Winter")
D2 = as.numeric(myData$Seasons == "Spring")
D3 = as.numeric(myData$Seasons == "Summer")

h0 = as.numeric(X1 == 0)
h1 = as.numeric(X1 == 1)
h2 = as.numeric(X1 == 2)
h3 = as.numeric(X1 == 3)
h4 = as.numeric(X1 == 4)
h5 = as.numeric(X1 == 5)
h6 = as.numeric(X1 == 6)

Even after editing our model, we encountered an issue with *EXTREMELY HIGH* 
multicollinearity. (Did this by calling VIF() function)

So, to solve this, we took out the NA rows in the summary statistics of the model, 
as well as inspected rows with high P-value. However, instead of removing specific 
interactions of X7 with hours, we decided to remove interactions of Hours with any 
variable whenever we encountered a significant number of NA values or high P-values 
in the summary statistics output. We iteratively conducted this process and checked
the VIF output. We needed to find a model with VIF values less than 10.

But, now the Q-Q residual plot does not align with the line y=x, and is *heavy-tailed*,
as indicated by the left Q-Q plot. Therefore, we conducted a Square-Root Transformation
and obtain the resulting Q-Q Plot, indicated by the middle graph. Now, we tried 
to align the Normal Q-Q plot with the line y = x. To do this, we applied the 
Box-Cox Transformation. We investigated this further and found that there is no 
significant effect on the distribution after applying a Box-Cox transformation, 
indicated by the right graph. Therefore, we only transform the response variable
by taking Y^0.5 (i.e., by only performing the square-root transformation).

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=10}
op = par(pty = "s", mfrow = c(1, 3))
qqnorm(almost_best_model$residuals)
qqline(almost_best_model$residuals)

qqnorm(best_model$residuals)
qqline(best_model$residuals)

qqnorm(box_coxed_best_model$residuals)
qqline(box_coxed_best_model$residuals)
par(op)
rm(op, almost_best_model, box_coxed_best_model)
```


Hence, we conclude that we have our final model, which is:


RentedBikeCount  = (Rainfall:Weekends + Visibility + Snowfall + Rainfall
                  + Humidity + Temperature + SolarRadiation + SolarRadiation:Weekend
                  + SolarRadiation:Seasons + Temperature:Weekend + Weekend:Hour + Hour)$^2$

### Cross Validation

We randomly choose 70% of our dataset to be the training set, and the remaining 30% to be the
validation set. Then we compare our MSPE and MSE to see if they were similar. 
Since the MSPR computed from the validation set was 35.493. MSE computed from the
training set was 36.020. Due to MSPR and MSE being fairly close, it can be 
concluded that our model is valid.

                                                                                    + h7 + h8 + h9
                                                                                   + h14 + h15 + h16 + h17
                                                                                    + h18 + h19 + h20 + h21 + h22) + (h0 + h1 + h2 + h3 + h4 + h5 + h6

## Diagnostics

### Regression Assumptions


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(best_model, 1)
plot(best_model, 2)
plot(best_model, 3)
```

Residual Vs. Fitted plot shows residuals are randomly and evenly distributed along
a mainly horizontal line, therefore the linear assumption is true. The normal Q-Q plot is
mostly linear with a slight left skew. Because the majority of data points are on the
line, we conclude the data is normal. Scale - Location plot shows randomly 
distributed points on a nearly horizontal line, therefore variance is homogeneous.

### Outlying Y Observations 

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Finding outliers with Studentized deleted residuals as indicator
t=rstudent(best_model)
alpha=.05
n=dim.data.frame(myData)[1]
p.prime=length(coef(best_model))
t.crit = qt(1-alpha/(2*n), n -p.prime-1)
# Index of outliers
out = which(abs(t) > t.crit)
```

Comparing studentized deleted residuals of each observation against our 
threshold (t.crit = 4.533), 7 observations stood out as outlying Y observations.

### High leverage X Observations

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Outlying X observations
hii = round(hatvalues(best_model), 2)
out2 = which(hii > 2*p.prime/n)
out3 = which(hii > .5)
```

Comparing the leverage of each observation against two times the mean leverage 
($\frac{2p'}{n}$ = 0.013), 86 observations stood out as high leverage X observations.
Comparing leverage of each observation against .5, 0 observations stood out as 
high leverage x observations.

### Influencial Observations

```{r echo=FALSE}
data.inf = influence.measures(best_model)
data.infmat = as.data.frame(data.inf$infmat)

# DFFITS
outliers = which(data.infmat$dffit > 2 * sqrt(p.prime/n))
```

Comparing Cook's Distance and DFBETAS against their respective thresholds, 0 influential observations were found.
Comparing DFFITS against its threshold (2*sqrt(p'/n) = 0.161), 129 influential observations were found.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#influential outlying Y
infouty = intersect(outliers, out)
#influential high leverage X
infoutx = intersect(outliers, out2)
#influencial outliers
infout = c(infouty, infoutx)
#noninfluencial outliers
noninfout = c(setdiff(out2, infout), setdiff(out,infout))
```

Overall, 3 outlying Y observations were influential, 22 high leverage X 
observations were influential. After looking closely at each influential outlying
observation, we determined that all points were naturally generated and will be 
kept in our dataset. As for the remaining non-influential outliers, there is no real
difference whether they remain in our dataset or not.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(olsrr)

# plot influencial points according to different indicators
p1 = ols_plot_cooksd_chart(best_model)
p2 = ols_plot_dffits(best_model)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=10}
ggarrange(p1, p2)
rm(p1, p2)
```

Looking at the cook's distance graph, 5 points are clearly larger than the 
rest (3950, 5052, 6454, 8307, 3965) and looking at DFFITs graph, a multitude of 
points lay above and below the threshold, confirming our calculations.

### Multicollinearity

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(regclass)
VIF(best_model)
```

The largest VIF was 9.196, for solar radiation, which is less than 10. The mean VIF was 
`r round(mean(VIF(best_model)), 3)`, which is not considerably larger than 1, 
therefore there is no indication of serious multicollinearity.

## Conclusion

When we first started working on the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset, our goal was to
figure out how the weather affected the number of bikes rented on an hourly basis.

Our findings showed that weather did not have as large of an effect as we 
anticipated, with the major effects being from the hour itself, i.e. eight in the
morning versus eight at night, whether it was a weekend or not as well as if it 
was raining. To be more conclusive, we found in order of most to least impact: 
hour, weekend, temperature, humidity and visibility. As well, we also found that
windspeed had no impact.

However, we also need to account for the limitations of our study:

1. The regression model we have developed is based on the models and techniques 
we had been exposed to during class. As such, there may be a better model and 
transformation that would fit our purposes better. 

2. The predictive model we have designed is based on a fixed data set and as 
such may not be as accurate when dealing with real-time data points. 

3. After applying our transformations, we found that our final models‚Äô residuals
appear left-skewed albeit trying boxcox which made it worse. 

4. Our model is also focused on Seoul as a whole, and the number of 
bikes rented on an hourly basis may vary amongst different parts of Seoul.

By creating a predictive model that can accurately estimate how many bikes will 
be needed in regards to a variety of areas, we can ensure that we meet the demand
for rental bikes. This is especially important due to the high annual growth rate
of rental bike use which can partly be attributed to the increasing awareness of 
climate change which has led people to prioritize more environmentally modes of 
transportation among others.

As such, potential areas for future research would be to go further into our data
and see how the number of bikes rented on an hourly basis varies amongst different
parts of Seoul to optimize the allocation of rental bikes in the city. As well, 
similar bike rental systems could be popularized and adapted across the world, 
such as Toronto which could help lower carbon emissions.
