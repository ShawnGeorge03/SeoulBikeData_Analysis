\textbf{\LARGE Introduction}

In the past decade the usage of public rental bikes have increased in various
urban cities. In many urban cities around the world, rental bikes have become a 
crucial part of the transportation system due to various reasons. They help to 
provide a free or affordable access of transportation for short-distance trips 
instead of using a private vehicles. They also help with reducing congestion, 
noise and air pollution in a busy city (Winters, 2020). Bike Sharing systems 
are now rapidly growing across the world with nearly 2000 various operating 
programs in total as of May 2021 (Yu et al., 2021) and the demand for these 
systems are growing at 14.3% compounded annually from 2017 to 2025 (Cooper, 2019). 

There are various public bike rental systems in place across the world, like in 
City of Toronto which has approximately 6,850 bikes where its users have 
completed 2.9 million trips as of 2020 (Bike Share Toronto, 2021). Another 
example is New York City which has a total of ___ bikes and its users have 
completed approximately 510,000 trips made in New York City alone as of 2020 with
a 35% growth in daily cycling between 2013 to 2018 (New York City DOT, 2021). 
Some of the largest bike sharing systems can be found in the Chinese cities of 
Hangzhou and Wuhan, where users have access to 90,000 and 70,000 bicycles, 
respectively (Borowska-Stefa≈Ñska et al., 2021). Therefore, effective management 
and model must developed to ensure the public can access the service when required.

Like many of those cities mentioned above, the city of Seoul in South Korea has 
also setup a bike sharing system called _Ddareungi_ or Seoul Bike was started in
2015 to tackle traffic congestion, high oil price, and air pollution in Seoul, 
and to create a healthier society thus improving the quality of life for the 
residents (V E et al., 2020).

The following paper will look at the data set from Seoul Bike to see how weather 
affects the number of bikes rented per hour and create a predictive model for 
future uses from the given data from December the 1st of 2017 to December the 1st
of 2018. This is an important question as in survey conducted in the geographical
region of Asia in 2016 identified, climate as an "... important physical barrier 
with 25% of respondents strongly agreeing that it constrains them physically, 
particularly warm or hot temperature and high precipitation levels."(Mateo-Babia
no et al., 2017) among other reasons like infrastructure issues and others

The following data set contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Wind 
speed, Visibility, Dew point, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the target 
is the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
